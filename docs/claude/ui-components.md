# UI components (`packages/ui`)

`packages/ui/src/components` holds stock shadcn components (style `base-vega`, Base UI primitives, `cn` from the `cn` package). Keep them byte-identical to the CLI output so they can be refreshed with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <name> --overwrite` (run in `packages/ui`); Biome ignores that directory on purpose. They need `@import "shadcn/tailwind.css"` in `globals.css` for their `data-*` custom variants.

- Never edit those files. Put layout tweaks in `className` at the call site, and anything global in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`.
- No z-index overrides on overlays: Base UI portals popups to body in open order, so the stock `z-50` stacks correctly.
- Non-modal dialogs (`modal={false}`) also pass `disablePointerDismissal` to `Dialog` and `data-modal="false"` to `DialogContent`; a rule in `globals.css` hides their backdrop, which Base UI renders even for non-modal dialogs. Dialogs with wide content need sizing classes on a phone: see `phone-layout.md`.
- Base UI APIs: `render={<X />}` instead of `asChild` (plus `nativeButton={false}` when `X` isn't a button), `Select` needs `items` for `SelectValue` to show labels, and `onValueChange` can receive `null`.
