# Agent skills

Skills are installed per project with the `skills` CLI (`pnpm dlx skills ...`) and committed: `.claude/skills/`, `.agents/skills/` and `skills-lock.json`. Only personal settings (`.claude/settings.local.json`) are git-ignored, and Biome ignores the skill files and the lock.
- `.claude/skills/` is the only directory Claude Code loads project skills from. It is a real directory; don't replace it with a symlink to another repo.
- Miden SDK skills ship inside the `@miden-sdk/*` npm packages and are symlinked, not copied: `.claude/skills/<name>` → `.agents/skills/<name>` → `apps/web/node_modules/@miden-sdk/*/skills/<name>`. They follow the installed SDK version, so they break until `pnpm install` has run. After an SDK bump that adds or removes skills, re-sync:

  ```bash
  pnpm dlx skills experimental_sync -r --agent claude-code --include '@miden-sdk/*' -y
  ```

- Third-party skills are copied in and recorded in `skills-lock.json`. Example: `shadcn` and `migrate-radix-to-base` from `pnpm dlx skills add shadcn/ui --skill '*' --agent claude-code -y`.
- `tutorials-qa` is a hand-written local skill in `.claude/skills/tutorials-qa/`, with no upstream source; don't delete it.
- Install skills at project level with `--agent claude-code`, not globally (`-g`), unless asked.

# Upgrading the Miden packages

When bumping `@miden-sdk/*`, also update `CLIENT_VERSION` in `apps/web/lib/utils/store.ts` to the new version. It stamps the stores the tutorials seed from `defaultStore`, and the SDK refuses to import a store stamped by a client newer than the running one. Bump every `@miden-sdk/*` pin in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` too (`minimumReleaseAgeExclude`, `overrides`).

# UI components

`packages/ui/src/components` holds stock shadcn components (style `base-vega`, Base UI primitives, `cn` from the `cn` package). Keep them byte-identical to the CLI output so they can be refreshed with `pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add <name> --overwrite` (run in `packages/ui`); Biome ignores that directory on purpose. They need `@import "shadcn/tailwind.css"` in `globals.css` for their `data-*` custom variants.
- Never edit those files. Put layout tweaks in `className` at the call site, and anything global in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`.
- No z-index overrides on overlays: Base UI portals popups to body in open order, so the stock `z-50` stacks correctly.
- Non-modal dialogs (`modal={false}`) also pass `disablePointerDismissal` to `Dialog` and `data-modal="false"` to `DialogContent`; a rule in `globals.css` hides their backdrop, which Base UI renders even for non-modal dialogs.
- Base UI APIs: `render={<X />}` instead of `asChild` (plus `nativeButton={false}` when `X` isn't a button), `Select` needs `items` for `SelectValue` to show labels, and `onValueChange` can receive `null`.
