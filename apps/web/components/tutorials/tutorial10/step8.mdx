Try invoking the **`get_count`** procedure from the _"Components"_ tab to see the new value of the counter which should have incremented from 0 to 1.

This tutorial demonstrates Miden's deployment flow:

1. **Contract Building**: We started by compiling both the counter account and increment note contracts
2. **Account Creation**: We created a counter account with initial storage (counter value = 0)
3. **Note Publishing**: We created an increment note and published it to the network
4. **Note Consumption**: The counter account consumed the note, executing the increment logic
5. **State Update**: The counter value increased and the change has been recorded onchain

This process shows how Miden contracts are deployed through state changes rather than separate deployment transactions.

Congratulations! You've successfully deployed and interacted with your first Miden smart contract. The Miden Playground provides the foundation for managing all aspects of your contract lifecycle.
