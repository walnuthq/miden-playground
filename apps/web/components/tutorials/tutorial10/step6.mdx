Let's create an **increment-note** by executing a transaction that will output our custom note incrementing the count of the **Counter Contract**.
You will need a connected wallet to sign the transaction so make sure your wallet is ready before continuing.

From the <Link href="/notes">notes page</Link>, click on the _"Add note"_ button and select the _"Create note"_ option.

A _"Create Note"_ dialog will show up to help you configure the note creation transaction.
First, select the **Counter Contract** deployed in the previous step and choose the **increment-note** script, leave the note type as public.

Do not add note assets, and leave the note inputs empty, as our note doesn't need to embed assets or take any parameters.

Once you're done configuring your custom note, click on the _"Create"_ button and sign the resulting transaction.

It will take some time for your note to be acknowledged by the network, wait until it appears in the notes list.
