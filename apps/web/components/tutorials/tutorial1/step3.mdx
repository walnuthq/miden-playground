In order to begin the process of funding our wallet, we first need to perform a mint transaction against the faucet Account. The role of this transaction is to initiate an asset transfer between the faucet and our wallet.

A [Note](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-base/note) is the medium through which Accounts communicate.
Notes hold assets and define how they can be consumed.
For instance our mint transaction will generate a note containing our test tokens, consumable only by our wallet.

From the <Link href={`/accounts/${props.faucet?.identifier}`}>faucet page</Link>, click on the _"Create new transaction"_ button then select _"New mint transaction"_ to craft your mint request. A _"Configure mint transaction"_ dialog will show up where you can select the target account (our newly created wallet) and an arbitrary amount eg. **100** tokens.

[Note type](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-base/note#note-storage-mode) refers to the privacy mode of the transaction you're about to create, it can be either **private** (known only to you) or **publicly** available on-chain. Leave it as it is and proceed with the preview of the mint transaction.

The preview step shows a quick summary of the changes about to be performed on the executing Account (in this case the MDN Faucet).
A Fungible Faucet stores the total circulating supply already minted in its first [storage slot](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-base/account/storage).

When you're ready to execute the transaction click on _"Submit"_, it will take some time as its execution results in the generation of a zero-knowledge proof, which is computation-heavy and depends on your underlying hardware.
