A [Transaction](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-docs/imported/miden-base/src/transaction.html) in Miden is the state transition of a single account. A Transaction takes as input a single account and zero or more notes, and outputs the same account with an updated state, together with zero or more notes.

Compared to most blockchains, where a Transaction typically involves more than one account (e.g., sender and receiver), a Transaction in Miden involves a single account.

In Miden, minting 1000 MDN tokens from a fungible faucet to a wallet takes two transactions, one in which the faucet creates a note containing 1000 MDN and one in which the wallet consumes that note and receives the 1000 MDN.

navigate to the mint transaction executed in the previous step and notice how it
created an output note that contains our MDN assets. To actually fund our
account we'll need to consume this note to transfer these assets in our wallet.
