You are probably familiar with the P2ID note as we used it in previous tutorials, but maybe it's the first time you deep dive into its actual implementation.

The script reads 2 values from the note inputs forming the target account ID which is decomposed in a prefix and a suffix.
The account ID needs to be split in 2 separate 64 bits **Felt**s as note inputs are encoded as a Felt array and account IDs are 120 bits.

The script then reads the consuming account ID using the account's interface function `account::get_id` and compares it against the note inputs.
If the 2 values are equal, the script proceeds with sending the note assets to the target account.

Now that we understand the P2ID implementation, let's add the timelock logic.
