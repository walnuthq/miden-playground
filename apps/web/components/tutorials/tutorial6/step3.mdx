[Account components](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-base/account/components) are the building blocks that define an account's [code](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-base/account/code) and [storage](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-base/account/storage).
Multiple account components can be merged together to deploy a final account on-chain.

As an example, consider a wallet account, capable of holding assets and requiring authentication to move funds. Such an account can be created by merging a **BasicWallet** component with a **Falcon512Rpo** authentication component.

The basic wallet contains the code to move assets in and out of the account vault. The authentication component holds a user's public key in storage and additionally contains the code to verify a signature against that public key. Together, these components form a fully functional wallet account.

From the <Link href="/components">components page</Link>, create a new account component to represent our Counter Contract functionality.
Select the Counter Contract script created in the first step and choose the **Account Component** type.
