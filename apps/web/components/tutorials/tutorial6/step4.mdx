Designing an Account Component is twofold:

- First we define a library of functions that can read and write to the storage slots of the component using a script written in Rust.
- Next, we define the storage layout that must specify a list of storage slots, and can optionally specify initial values for each of the slots.

Let's add a storage slot to our **Counter Contract** component, you must name it `**miden::component::miden_counter_contract::count_map**` to use the same identifier that was hardcoded in the Account Component.
For convenience, you can copy the slot name from here: <CopyButton content="Copy Storage Slot Name" copy="miden::component::miden_counter_contract::count_map" />

Select **StorageMap** as storage slot type and set an initial default value for the counter at the fixed key **1**.
