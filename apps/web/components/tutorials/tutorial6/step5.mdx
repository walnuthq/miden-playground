Now that we both defined our [AccountCode](https://docs.miden.xyz/design/miden-base/account/code/) using a script and [AccountStorage](https://docs.miden.xyz/design/miden-base/account/storage/) using an account component, it's time to deploy our contract on testnet.

From the <Link href="/accounts">accounts page</Link>, click on _"Create new account"_ and select the _"Deploy account"_ option.

Give your new contract a name and select **NoAuth** as authentication component: our counter contract doesn't require authentication as we allow any user to interact with it without requiring signature verification.

After selecting your custom **Counter Contract** account component, you will be given the opportunity to overwrite the storage slots default values.

When you're done configuring your contract deployment, click on the _"Deploy"_ button to create your account locally: you will need to perform at least one transaction against it before it is acknowledged by testnet.
