Designing an Account Component is twofold:

- First we define a library of functions that can read and write to the storage slots of the component using a script written in Rust.
- Next, we define the storage layout that must specify a contiguous list of slot values that starts at index 0, and can optionally specify initial values for each of the slots.

Let's add a storage slot to our **Counter Contract** component of type **StorageMap** and set an initial default value for the counter at the fixed key **1**.
