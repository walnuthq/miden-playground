Let's focus on lines _12-17_ in the Rust source code of the Counter Contract script, where the contract structure is defined.
This contract uses a [Map Slot](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-base/account/storage#map-slots) to store the counter value, a **StorageMap** holds key-value pairs and both keys and values are of type [Word](https://docs.miden.xyz/glossary#word).

The **get_count** procedure defined at lines _22-25_ returns the current counter stored in the contract [AccountStorage](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-base/account/storage) as a [Felt](https://docs.miden.xyz/glossary#felt).
A fixed key is predefined using the Word constant value 1 and the corresponding value is retrieved within the map and truncated to a single Felt.

Finally, the **increment_count** procedure at lines _28-34_ is responsible for incrementing the counter value and returning it, using similar code as the getter method.

For the purpose of this tutorial, let's modify the increment value to something else than **1** and compile the script to [Miden Assembly](https://docs.miden.xyz/glossary#miden-assembly).
