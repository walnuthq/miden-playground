Let's focus on lines _13-18_ in the Rust source code of the Counter Contract script, where the contract structure is defined.
This contract uses a [Value Slot](https://docs.miden.xyz/design/miden-base/account/storage/#value-slots) to store the counter in its first storage slot, a **Value** represents a single [Word](https://docs.miden.xyz/builder/glossary/#word) of storage data.

The **`get_count`** procedure defined at lines _23-25_ returns the current counter stored in the contract [AccountStorage](https://docs.miden.xyz/builder/glossary/#accountstorage) as a [Felt](https://docs.miden.xyz/builder/glossary/#felt).
We simply return the Word value stored in the count storage slot truncated to a single Felt.

Finally, the **`increment_count`** procedure at lines _28-33_ is responsible for incrementing the counter value and returning it, using similar code as the getter method.

In the next step, we'll focus on the compiled **MASM** code so if you want to deep dive into the underlying Miden VM architecture click on the _"MASM"_ tab, otherwise feel free to skip this step.
