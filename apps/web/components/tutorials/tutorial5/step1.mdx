In this tutorial, we will interact with a counter contract already deployed on chain by incrementing the count using the Miden Playground.

Using a custom transaction, we will invoke the increment function within the counter contract to update the count. This tutorial provides a foundational understanding of interacting with custom smart contracts on Miden.

In Miden, Smart Contracts are implemented through custom accounts, their [code](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-base/account/code) can be written in Rust and compiled to [Miden Assembly](https://docs.miden.xyz/glossary#miden-assembly) before being deployed on chain.

Let's dive into the Counter Contract code by understanding how the **get_count** and **increment_count** procedures are implemented.
