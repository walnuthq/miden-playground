In this tutorial, we will build a simple counter smart contract that maintains a count, deploy it to the Miden testnet, and interact with it by incrementing the count.

Using a script, we will invoke the increment function within the counter contract to update the count. This tutorial provides a foundational understanding of developing and deploying custom smart contracts on Miden.

Let's get started by clicking on _"Create new script"_ then choose a name and make sure to select an **Account Script** using the **Counter Contract** example.
