In the previous step we had a look at the higher-level **Rust** source code of the Counter Contract, now let's focus on the compiled **MASM** output.

Here's a breakdown of what the **`get_count`** procedure does:

1. Pushes the slot ID prefix and suffix for **`miden::component::miden_counter_contract::counter`** onto the stack.
2. Calls **`active_account::get_item`** with the slot ID.
3. Calls **`sys::truncate_stack`** to truncate the stack to size 16.
4. The value returned from **`active_account::get_item`** is still on the stack and will be returned when this procedure is called.

Here's a breakdown of what the **`increment_count`** procedure does:

1. Pushes the slot ID prefix and suffix for **`miden::component::miden_counter_contract::counter`** onto the stack.
2. Calls **`active_account::get_item`** with the slot ID.
3. Pushes **`1`** onto the stack.
4. Adds **`1`** to the count value returned from **`active_account::get_item`**.
5. Pushes the slot ID prefix and suffix again so we can write the updated count.
6. Calls **`native_account::set_item`** which saves the incremented count to storage.
7. Calls **`sys::truncate_stack`** to truncate the stack to size 16.
