An [Account](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-docs/imported/miden-base/src/account.html) represents the primary entity of the protocol. Capable of holding assets, storing data, and executing custom code. Each Account is a specialized smart contract providing a programmable interface for interacting with its state and assets.

Users can choose whether their Accounts are stored **publicly** or **privately**. The [storage mode](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-docs/imported/miden-base/src/account.html#account-storage-mode) is chosen during Account creation, it cannot be changed later.

- **Public Accounts**: The account's state is stored on-chain, similar to how accounts are stored in public blockchains like Ethereum.
- **Private Accounts**: Only a commitment (hash) to the account's state is stored on-chain. This mode is suitable for users who prioritize privacy or plan to store a large amount of data in their Account.

For the purpose of this tutorial, let's create a **public** wallet Account and fund it using a faucet.
