Your **Private** wallet is funded and your privacy has been preserved as it's impossible to link the 2 transactions that were necessary to transfer the tokens from the faucet to your account, neither is it possible to read on-chain data that would link your private wallet address to the mint request.

Now let's use your **Private** wallet to send some tokens to your **Public** wallet using the same private communication channel enabled by **Private** notes.

Click on the _"Create new transaction"_ button and select the _"New send transaction"_ option: a _"Configure send transaction"_ modal will show up.

Click on the Miden Wallet browser extension and then click on the wallet selection dropdown to pick your public wallet.
Copy your public wallet address to the clipboard and paste it inside the _"Target account"_ input of the send transaction modal.

Select the **MIDEN** asset and enter an amount eg. **10** tokens, leave the note type as **Private**.

Finally, click on the _"Preview"_ button to confirm the send transaction and create a new **Private** P2ID output note embedding your sent tokens.
