Now that we've compiled the **Counter Contract** script, let's deploy it.

From the <Link href="/accounts">accounts page</Link>, click on _"Create new account"_ and select the _"Deploy account"_ option.

Give your new contract a name and select **No Auth** as authentication component and our custom **Counter Contract** account component.

When you're done configuring your contract deployment, click on the _"Deploy"_ button to create your account.

Every contract deployed using the Miden Playground is automatically verified upon deployment.
This is the reason why we're able to invoke our account procedures using their human-readable names such as **`get_count`** or **`reset_count`** under the _"Components"_ tab of the contract details page.

See for yourself: {props.counter ? <Link href={`/accounts/${props.counter.identifier}?tab=components`}>click on the <em>"Components"</em> tab of your deployed account</Link> : <>click on the <em>"Components"</em> tab of your deployed account</>} to access the list of verified components your smart contract contains, you will also be able to read the underlying script source code by clicking on the _"Script"_ link.

When a contract is verified, anyone can import it and start interacting with it on the playground as well as access the Rust source code.
