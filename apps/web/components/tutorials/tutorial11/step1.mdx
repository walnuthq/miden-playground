Following up on the previous tutorial, we'll discover what is contract verification and why it's important in blockchain decentralized applications.

Contract verification is the process of confirming that the deployed bytecode of a smart contract on a blockchain matches its original human-readable source code.
This ensures transparency, allowing users to inspect the contract's logic and verify that it functions as intended without hidden vulnerabilities or malicious modifications.
It is a foundational step in building security, trust, and credibility in blockchain applications.
