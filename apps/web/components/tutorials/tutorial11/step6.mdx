import Link from "@/components/tutorials/tutorial-link";

Back on the <Link href={`/accounts/${props.counter?.identifier}?tab=components`}>imported contract components page</Link>, click on the _"Verify account component"_ button and upload the folder you extracted from the downloaded script archive.

This process will take some time as we need to recompile the submitted script server-side and compare the resulting [MASM](https://docs.miden.xyz/builder/glossary/#miden-assembly) code against the unverified contract [AccountCode](https://docs.miden.xyz/builder/glossary/#accountcode).

The verification will be successful if we're able to find a match and assert that the unverified account exports the same procedures defined in the uploaded source code.

The verified [AccountComponent](https://docs.miden.xyz/builder/glossary/#accountcomponent) should be appended to the account verified components list and you will be able to start interacting with this contract within the playground.
