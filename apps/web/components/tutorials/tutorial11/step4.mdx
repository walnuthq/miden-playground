But what happens when we import an account that isn't verified?

Let's find out by clicking on the _"Import"_ button, this will import a **Counter Contract** using the same source code as the script we compiled previously but since it was deployed from outside the playground it wasn't automatically verified for us.

<ImportButton />

When the contract is imported, {props.counter ? <Link href={`/accounts/${props.counter.identifier}?tab=components`}>click on its address and head to the <em>"Components"</em> tab</Link> : <>click on its address and head to the <em>"Components"</em> tab</>}: at the moment we have no verified account components on this account (except for the **No Auth** component which is a default component always automatically verified) and it behaves like a blackbox, only dApps aware of this contract interface can interact with it.

**So how can we verify this contract?**

One of the option is to add verified account components by providing the original source code that was used to build and deploy this contract on-chain.
