Congratulations! You have successfully used the most exciting feature of Miden: privacy preserving transactions.

You have successfully funded a private wallet without revealing the details of the minting request (tokens amount, recipient address) and your balance will always be private to you.

You can off-ramp assets from the private layer anytime without linking your public wallet with your private wallet, only the balance of your public wallet is known to the outside world.
