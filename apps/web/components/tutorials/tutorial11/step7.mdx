Since the contract is verified, you can call its procedures as the interface is now available to everyone.

Increment and reset the count of this newly verified **Counter Contract** to test the unlocked **Read/Write** contract feature that verification enables.

Note that this verification process is not happening locally, meaning that anyone can now read the source of this contract and interact with it on-chain.

You can test it after finishing this tutorial by importing the contract again in a new testnet sandbox environment.

- **Name**: Verified Contract <CopyButton content="Copy Account Name" copy="Verified Contract" />

- **Address**:

<AccountAddress account={props.counter} withLink={false} />

Congratulations! You discovered what contract verification is all about and verified your first contract on the Miden Playground.
