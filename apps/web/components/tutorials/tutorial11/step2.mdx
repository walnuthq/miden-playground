Now that your **Private** wallet is connected, let's fund it by requesting tokens from the **Public** [Miden Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.miden.io/).

Let's use a **Private** note to keep this wallet funding secret: only the note's hash will be stored publicly.
The Note's actual data will remain off-chain, enhancing privacy.

While the faucet is a **Public** account and our wallet is **Private**, the note's data will be only known by the 2 parties involved.
This means that from the outside world, we can observe the faucet being depleted but we can't track the intended recipient of the outgoing tokens.

Click on the _"Mint"_ button to automatically request 100 tokens from the Miden Faucet privately.
Once the note has been created, you will be prompted to download it on your device.

**Important**: if you lose this note file, your tokens cannot be recovered.
Keep it safe and do not share it.
