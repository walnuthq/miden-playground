Navigate to <Link href={`/accounts/${props.walletA?.address}`}>Wallet A</Link> and take a look under the assets table: here are the 1000 MDN tokens we'd like to transfer to <Link href={`/accounts/${props.walletB.address}`}>Wallet B</Link> which has no assets at the moment.

To initiate a transfer, you first need to create a send transaction from **Wallet A** to **Wallet B**. From **Wallet A** page, click on the _"Create new transaction"_ then _"New send transaction"_.

A _"Configure send transaction"_ dialog will show up where you can select the recipient account (**Wallet B**), the asset you want to transfer out (**MDN tokens**) and the amount to send eg. 1000 tokens.

The preview step shows a quick summary of the changes about to be performed on **Wallet B**. When you're ready to execute the transaction click on _"Submit"_.
