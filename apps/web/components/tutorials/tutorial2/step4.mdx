The next step to finish our transfer is to consume the output note with the intended target account.

From <Link href={`/accounts/${props.walletB.identifier}`}>Wallet B</Link> page, take a look at the _"Consumable Notes"_ section and see how we automatically detected the **P2ID** output note as consumable by its recipient.

Click on the _"Consume all notes"_ button to trigger a consume note transaction. In this scenario we have only one consumable note, but we could consume an arbitrary number of notes in a single transaction.

The preview dialog will let you validate the assets changes about to occur, then click _"Submit"_ to finalize the transfer.

Take a look at this animated diagram: in this tutorial, **Account 1** is <Link href={`/accounts/${props.walletA.identifier}`}>Wallet A</Link> and **tx1** is the send transaction performed in step #2.
**Account 2** is <Link href={`/accounts/${props.walletB.identifier}`}>Wallet B</Link> and **tx2** is the consume transaction you've just submitted.
