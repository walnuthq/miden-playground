Our Counter Contract has been imported into the Playground, and we can now start interacting with it.

First, click on the _"Components"_ tab in the account details page to access the Counter Contract [account components](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-base/account/components).

In the procedures section of the account component, click on the _"Invoke"_ button next to the **get_count** procedure to get the current value of the counter.

Next, click on the _"Invoke"_ button of the **increment_count** procedure to invoke it and increment the previous value by one.
