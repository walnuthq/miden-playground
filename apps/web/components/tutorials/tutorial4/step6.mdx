Disconnect your **Private** wallet from the playground and re-connect using the **Public** wallet used as recipient in the previous step.

From your {props.wallet ? <Link href={`/accounts/${props.wallet.identifier}`}>public wallet details page</Link> : 'public wallet details page'}, you should be able to see the **Private** note we created previously in the list of consumable notes.

Click on the <EllipsisVertical className="size-4 inline" /> icon button in the _"Consumable Notes"_ table to consume the **Private** note with your **Public** wallet.

You might wonder why we didn't need to export the private note file generated by the Miden Wallet browser extension and import it back in the playground just like we did for the mint transaction.

While it would be a totally valid operation, it would be impractical so Miden provides a [Note Transport Layer](https://docs.miden.xyz/design/miden-base/account/address#communicating-channel-information) to exchange private notes in a more user-friendly way without sacrificing privacy as the system supports end-to-end encryption.

You can always opt-out from this system and use your own private communication side channel to exchange notes.
