Let's focus on lines _26-32_ in the Rust source code of the Counter Contract script, where the contract structure is defined.
This contract uses a [Value Slot](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-docs/imported/miden-base/src/account/storage.html#value-slots) to store the counter in its first storage slot, a **Value** represents a single [Word](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-docs/glossary.html#word) of storage data.

The **get_count** procedure defined at lines _38-43_ returns the current counter stored in the contract [AccountStorage](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-docs/glossary.html#accountstorage) as a [Felt](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-docs/glossary.html#felt).
We simply return the Word value stored in the count storage slot truncated to a single Felt.

Finally, the **increment_count** procedure at lines _46-56_ is responsible for incrementing the counter value and returning it, using similar code as the getter method.

In the next step, we'll focus on the compiled **MASM** code so if you want to deep dive into the underlying Miden VM architecture click on the _"MASM"_ tab, otherwise feel free to skip this step.
