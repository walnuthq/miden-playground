In the previous step, we imported a private note containing 100 tokens from the public [Miden Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.miden.io/), now let's consume this note to fund our private wallet.

From your {props.wallet ? <Link href={`/accounts/${props.wallet.identifier}`}>private wallet details page</Link> : 'private wallet details page'}, click on the <EllipsisVertical className="size-4 inline" /> icon button in the _"Consumable Notes"_ table to consume the note with your wallet.

A _"Confirm Transaction"_ modal from your Miden Wallet will show up asking you to sign the resulting consume transaction that will transfer the tokens to your account.

The private note will transition to the **Consumed** state and disappear from your wallet consumable notes.
