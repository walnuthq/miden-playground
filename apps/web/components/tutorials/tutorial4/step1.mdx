In this tutorial, we'll discover how to make private transactions and move assets between wallets using the Miden playground.

You should already have created and funded a **Public** wallet in the previous tutorial.
You will also need to create a **Private** wallet to complete this tutorial.

The main difference between **Public** and **Private** accounts is how their state is handled: while a public account state is entirely stored on-chain, only a commitment (hash) to a private account's state is stored on-chain.

In Miden, when you are the custodian of your account state (in the case of a private wallet), **losing this state amounts to losing your funds**, similar to losing a private key.

Click on the Miden Wallet browser extension to select a **Private** account, if you don't have any, create a new one by clicking on your current account dropdown then click on _"Add account"_, make sure to select the _"Off-chain Account (Private)"_ option.

Connect your **Private** wallet by clicking on _"Select Wallet"_, you will be requested access to your **Private** account state, accept and click on _"Connect"_.
