In the previous step we had a look at the higher-level **Rust** source code of the Counter Contract, now let's focus on the compiled **MASM** output.

Here's a breakdown of what the **get_count** procedure does:

- Pushes 0 onto the stack, representing the index of the storage slot to read.
- Calls **account::get_item** with the index of 0.
- Calls **sys::truncate_stack** to truncate the stack to size 16.
- The value returned from **account::get_item** is still on the stack and will be returned when this procedure is called.

Here's a breakdown of what the **increment_count** procedure does:

- Pushes 0 onto the stack, representing the index of the storage slot to read.
- Calls **account::get_item** with the index of 0.
- Pushes 1 onto the stack.
- Adds 1 to the count value returned from **account::get_item**.
- For demonstration purposes, calls **debug.stack** to see the state of the stack
- Pushes 0 onto the stack, which is the index of the storage slot we want to write to.
- Calls **account::set_item** which saves the incremented count to storage at index 0
- Calls **sys::truncate_stack** to truncate the stack to size 16.
