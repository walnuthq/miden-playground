In the previous step, we downloaded the private note locally on our device.
This P2ID note encodes the intended recipient of its embedded assets in the note private data.

**Public** notes data is stored in the [note database](https://docs.miden.xyz/design/miden-base/state/#note-database), making it fully visible on-chain: this means we can automatically import them in the playground by listening to the Miden blockchain activity.

On the contrary, **Private** notes are invisible to the outside world and must be first imported in the playground before we can interact with them.

From the <Link href="/notes">notes page</Link>, click on _"Add note"_ and select the _"Import note"_ option.

Upload the note file (note.mno) using the file picker, click on _"Import"_ and your private note will be available in the playground.
