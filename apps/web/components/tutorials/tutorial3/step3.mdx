import { EllipsisVertical } from "lucide-react";

In the previous step, we requested 100 tokens from the public [Miden Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.miden.io/).

The resulting output note containing our tokens must now be consumed to fund our wallet.

Click on the <EllipsisVertical className="size-4 inline" /> icon button in the _"Consumable Notes"_ table to consume the note with your wallet.

A _"Confirm Transaction"_ modal from your Miden Wallet will show up asking you to sign the resulting consume transaction that will transfer the tokens to your account.

The note will transition to the **Consumed** state and disappear from your wallet consumable notes.
