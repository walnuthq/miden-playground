Now that your wallet is connected, let's fund it by requesting tokens from the public [Miden Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.miden.io/).

Click on the _"Mint"_ button to publicly request 100 tokens from the faucet.

Notice how the note containing your requested tokens automatically appears under the _"Consumable Notes"_ section of your connected wallet.
