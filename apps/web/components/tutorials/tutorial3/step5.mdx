import { EllipsisVertical } from "lucide-react";

Our recipient has been imported and you can now send tokens to its address.

Click on the <EllipsisVertical className="size-4 inline" /> icon button in your own wallet row in the accounts table to open the create transaction menu.

Select the _"New send transaction"_ option to open the configuration modal and select the recipient wallet as Target Account and the Miden Faucet as asset to transfer.

Clicking on the _"Preview"_ button will ask you to confirm the send transaction and create a corresponding output note encapsulating your sent tokens.

You will need to click on the Miden Wallet browser extension pinned icon to actually trigger the transaction, don't close the new tab responsible for generating the transaction until it's completed.
