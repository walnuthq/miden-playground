Our recipient has been imported and you can now send tokens to its address.

Click on the <EllipsisVertical className="size-4 inline" /> icon button in your own wallet row in the accounts table to open the create transaction menu.

Select the _"New send transaction"_ option to open the configuration modal and select the recipient wallet as the Target Account and Miden Faucet as the asset.

Clicking on the _"Preview"_ button will ask you to confirm the send transaction and create a corresponding output note encapsulating your sent tokens.
