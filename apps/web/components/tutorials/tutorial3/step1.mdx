In this tutorial, we will connect our [Miden Wallet](https://miden.fi/) to the Playground and sign simple transactions (mint assets, send assets to another wallet).

Make sure the Miden Wallet extension is pinned in your browser, then click on the _"Select Wallet"_ button to accept the connection request from Miden Playground.

The Playground will automatically import your account, once it appears in the accounts page, {props.wallet ? <Link href={`/accounts/${props.wallet.address}`}>click on its ID</Link> : 'click on its ID'} to inspect it and proceed to the next step.
