In this tutorial, we will connect our [Miden Wallet](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/miden-wallet/ablmompanofnodfdkgchkpmphailefpb?hl=en) to the Playground and sign simple transactions (mint assets, send assets to another wallet).

Make sure the Miden Wallet extension is pinned in your browser, then click on the _"Select Wallet"_ button to accept the connection request from Miden Playground.
For this tutorial, you'll need a **Public** wallet, if you created a **Private** wallet don't use it and create a new wallet instead.

The Playground will automatically import your wallet, once it appears in the accounts page, {props.wallet ? <Link href={`/accounts/${props.wallet.identifier}`}>click on its ID</Link> : 'click on its ID'} to inspect it and proceed to the next step.
