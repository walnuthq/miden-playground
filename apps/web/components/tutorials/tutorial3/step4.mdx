Now that your wallet is funded, we'd like to transfer tokens to another recipient's wallet.

To initiate a send transaction and transfer some tokens, you'll need to import a recipient account in the Playground.

This can be another wallet you control or the wallet of a friend. You can also send some tokens to this test wallet:

- **Name**: Test Wallet <CopyButton content="Copy Account Name" copy="Test Wallet" />

- **Address**:

<AccountAddress account={props.account} withLink={false} />

Head to the <Link href="/accounts">accounts page</Link> and import the recipient wallet by clicking on the _"Create new account"_ button on top of the page and selecting the _"Import account"_ option.

A modal will show up requesting both a name and the address of your newly imported account.
