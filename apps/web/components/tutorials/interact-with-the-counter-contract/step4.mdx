Our Counter Contract has been imported in the Playground and we can now start interacting with it.

First, click on the _"Components"_ tab in the account details page to access the Counter Contract [account components](https://0xmiden.github.io/miden-docs/glossary.html#accountcomponent).

In the procedures section of the account component, click on the _"Invoke"_ button next to the **get_count** procedure to get the current value of the counter.

Next, click on the _"Invoke"_ button of the **increment_count** procedure to invoke it and increment the previous value by one.
