The **Count Reader** script is similar to the previously encountered <Link href="/scripts/counter-contract">Counter Contract script</Link>, it's defining a [storage value slot](https://docs.miden.xyz/design/miden-base/account/storage/#value-slots) to store its own counter value that will be copied from the **Counter Contract**.

Let's focus on lines _22-29_ in the Rust source code of the **Count Reader** script, where the **`copy_count`** function is defined.

The **`copy_count`** procedure takes 2 arguments:

- **`counter_account_id`**: The account ID of the source contract from which to copy the counter value.
- **`get_count_proc_hash`**: The procedure hash of the procedure that should be called on the source contract to fetch the counter value.

The **`copy_count`** function executes a foreign procedure invocation with the arguments provided, calling **`get_count`** on the **Counter Contract** account.

The final argument of **`execute_foreign_procedure`** is the list of arguments to pass to the invoked procedure, which is left empty as **`get_count`** doesn't take any.

The **`get_count`** result is returned as the first item in a [Felt](https://docs.miden.xyz/builder/glossary/#felt) array, which is written back to [contract storage](https://docs.miden.xyz/builder/glossary/#accountstorage).

Note that this **`copy_count`** procedure is generic thanks to the function parameters: we can copy the value from any source contract using any procedure as long it takes no arguments and returns a **Felt**.
