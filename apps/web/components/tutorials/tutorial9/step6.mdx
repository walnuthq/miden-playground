Congratulations! You have successfully used the Miden Playground to perform your first Foreign Procedure Invocation.

In this tutorial we created a smart contract that calls the **`get_count`** procedure in the **Counter Contract** using FPI, and then saves the returned value to its local storage using the playground.
