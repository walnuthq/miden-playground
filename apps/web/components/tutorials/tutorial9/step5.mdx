Now that we've compiled both our **counter-account** and **increment-note** scripts, it's time to actually deploy our smart contract and interact with it using notes.

From the <Link href="/accounts">Accounts page</Link>, click on _"Create new account"_ and select the _"Deploy account"_ option.

Give your new contract a name and select **NoAuth** as authentication component: our counter contract doesn't require authentication as we allow any user to interact with it without requiring signature verification.
It means that any user will be able to make the counter account consume the increment note.

When you're done configuring your contract deployment, click on the _"Deploy"_ button to create your account locally.

**Miden's Deployment Flow**: In Miden, accounts (contracts) become visible onchain only when they undergo a state change.
Simply creating an account locally doesn't deploy it - the account must participate in a transaction that modifies its state.

In our case, we'll increment the counter by creating and consuming an **increment-note**, effectively "deploying" the contract and making it visible on the [Miden testnet explorer](https://testnet.midenscan.com/).
This is why the increment operation serves both as the deployment and the first interaction with the contract.
