On the _"Components"_ tab of your newly deployed account, you can access the **Count Reader** component to invoke the **`copy_count`** procedure.

You can read the initial counter value by hovering the **Counter** _"Value"_ column in the _"Storage Slots"_ table and confirm it was initialized to zero.

Click on the _"Invoke"_ button of **`copy_count`** to open a modal that will let you configure the procedure arguments.

We need to select the **Counter Contract** account as the first parameter which is the source account from which to copy the counter value.

The **`get_count`** procedure hash can be obtained from the **Counter Contract** account component page by clicking on the _"Copy Procedure Hash"_ button next to the procedure name.
For convenience, you can also copy it from here: <CopyButton content="Copy Procedure Hash" copy={COUNTER_CONTRACT_GET_COUNT_PROC_HASH} />

After setting the procedure parameters, click on the _"Invoke"_ button to trigger a new custom transaction calling **`copy_count`**, check the storage slot value again and confirm it now holds a copy of the **Counter Contract** counter value.
