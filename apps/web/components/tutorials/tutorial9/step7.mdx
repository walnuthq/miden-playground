In the previous step, we performed a transaction to publish an **increment-note** on Miden testnet.

The resulting output note must now be consumed by the **Counter Contract** to actually increment the count of our smart contract.

From the <Link href={`/accounts/${props.counter?.address}`}>Counter Contract account details page</Link>, click on the <EllipsisVertical className="size-4 inline" /> icon button in the _"Consumable Notes"_ table to consume the note with the **Counter Contract**.

A _"Preview consume transaction"_ modal will show up, click on the _"Submit"_ button to trigger the note consumption process.

The note will transition to the **Consumed** state and disappear from the consumable notes.
