Let's create the network note by executing a transaction that will output our custom note.
You will need a connected wallet to sign the transaction so make sure your Miden Wallet is connected to the playground before continuing.

From the <Link href="/notes">notes page</Link>, click on the _"Add note"_ button and select the _"Create note"_ option.

A _"Create Note"_ dialog will show up to help you configure the note creation transaction.
First, select the counter network deployed in step #2 and choose the counter note script, leave the note type as public.

Do not add note assets, and leave the note inputs empty, as our note doesn't need to embed assets or take any parameters.

Once you're done configuring your custom note, click on the _"Create"_ button and sign the resulting transaction.

It will take some time for your note to be acknowledged and consumed by the network.
