Your custom note has been automatically consumed by a network transaction and you can now check that the network counter value has been incremented from 1 to 2.

On the <Link href={`/accounts/${props.counter.identifier}`}>network counter page</Link>, click on the _"Components"_ tab and try calling the **`get_count`** procedure to confirm the network counter was incremented by the network transaction.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a network smart contract and triggered a network transaction using a custom note.
