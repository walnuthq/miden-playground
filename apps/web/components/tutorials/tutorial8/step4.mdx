Our network counter being registered on-chain, let's create a public note that the network operator can consume to execute the increment function.
This will increment the counter from 1 to 2.

Take some time to get familiar with the <Link href="/scripts/counter-note">counter note script</Link>.

First, we fetch the current count value before the increment and then call the **`increment_count`** procedure.
The script computes the expected count value after incrementation and compares it against the final count value returned by the Counter Contract **`get_count`** procedure.
The note script would fail if the increment logic wasn't correctly implemented by the contract.

The next step will be to create a custom network note with this script and register it on the network by signing a transaction.

A network note is a public note targetting a network account.
Once it's acknowledged by the network transaction builder, it will be automatically consumed by executing a transaction against the targetted network account.
