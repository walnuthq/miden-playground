import { EllipsisVertical } from "lucide-react";

In the previous step, we requested 100 tokens from the public [Miden Faucet](https://faucet.testnet.miden.io/).

The resulting output note containing our tokens must now be consumed to fund our wallet.

Click on the <EllipsisVertical className="size-4 inline" /> icon button in the _"Consumable Notes"_ table to consume the note with your wallet.

A _"Confirm Transaction"_ modal from your Miden Wallet will show up asking you to sign the resulting consume transaction that will transfer the tokens to your account.

You will need to click on the Miden Wallet browser extension pinned icon to actually trigger the transaction, don't close the new tab responsible for generating the transaction until it's completed.
