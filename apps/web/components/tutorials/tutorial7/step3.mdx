We assume the timelock block height will be appended as the 3rd item in the note inputs, let's store it in a variable for future use:

```rust
let timelock_height = inputs[2];
```

To get the current block height, we'll use the transaction kernel `get_block_number` call:

```rust
let block_number = tx::get_block_number();
```

Finally, we must check that `block_number` ≥ `timelock_height`:

```rust
assert!(block_number >= timelock_height);
```

After adding the timelock logic to your script, compile it and proceed to the next step.
