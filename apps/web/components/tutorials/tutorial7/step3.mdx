Now that our network account is deployed, we must execute a transaction performing a procedure invocation (**increment_count**) that creates a necessary state change for our contract to be deployed and stored on the network on-chain.
In Miden, network contracts must have their state modified through a transaction to be properly registered and committed to the blockchain - simply creating the account isn't sufficient for network storage mode.

Navigate to your network account by <Link href={`/accounts/${props.counter?.address}`}>clicking on its ID</Link>, on the _"Components"_ tab, you can access the account components to perform an initial transaction on this newly created smart contract.

Click on the _"Invoke"_ button of **increment_count** to trigger a custom transaction and increment the counter.
