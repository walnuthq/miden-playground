Unlike local transactions that require users to execute and prove, network transactions are executed and proven by a network transaction builder.

We'll build a network counter smart contract using the same code as the regular counter, but with different [storage configuration](https://docs.miden.xyz/miden-base/account/id#account-storage-mode) to enable network execution.

Then we'll create a note interacting with the network counter and let the network transaction builder actually consume and process the note.

Network transactions are executed and proven by the Miden operator rather than the client. They are useful for:

- **Public shared state**: Multiple users can interact with the same contract state without race conditions.
- **Autonomous execution**: Smart contracts can execute when conditions are met without user intervention.
- **Resource-constrained devices**: Clients that can't generate ZK proofs efficiently.
- **AMM applications**: Using network notes, you can build sophisticated AMMs where trades execute automatically.

The main trade-off is reduced privacy since the operator can see transaction inputs.
