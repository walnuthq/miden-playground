Our network counter being registered on-chain, let's create a public note that the network operator can consume to execute the increment function.
This will increment the counter from 1 to 2.

Take some time to get familiar with the <Link href="/scripts/counter-note">counter note script</Link> which is very basic: we simply call the network counter **increment_count** procedure within the note script.

The next step will be to create a custom network note with this script and register it on the network by signing a transaction.

A network note is a public note targetting a network account.
Once it's acknowledged by the network transaction builder, it will be automatically consumed by executing a transaction against the targetted network account.
