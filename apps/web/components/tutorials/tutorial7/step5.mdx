Congratulations! You have successfully used the Miden Playground to create your first custom note using a timelock pattern.

You have performed advanced testnet operations including developing your own custom note script and using it to create a custom note on the network.

Click on the <Link href={`/accounts/${getIdentifierPart(TEST_WALLET_ADDRESS)}`}>Test Wallet</Link> account details page to validate that the note you created is consumable by this account, but the wallet wouldn't be able to claim the assets in the note until after the configured time locked block height has been reached.
